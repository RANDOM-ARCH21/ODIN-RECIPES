        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>a flour tortilla rolled or folded around a filling (as of meat, beans, and cheese). </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Tortilla</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Bean</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li> chilli Pepper</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <p> <li>Heat your oven to 350Â° F and then go to work. First, set up your mise en place: your meat of choice, heated refried beans (canned is fine), cooked long grain rice, grated cheese (swiss, jack, cheddar, or a mix) or crumbled queso fresco, chopped cilantro (optional), chopped cabbage, salsa of your preference -- 
                homemade is best, but you can use a jarred salsa. I like the Rick Bayless tomatillo
                 style.</li> </p>

            <p>   <li> Tear off a sheet of aluminum foil just larger than the big flour tortilla you are about to lay on top of it. You need the largest tortilla you can find for this -- I use 10-inch. Next, cover the midsection of your tortilla with a layer of beans and your cheese of choice. Spoon on some rice, 
                    chopped cabbage, a sprinkle of cilantro, and then a generous drizzle of salsa. 
                    That is the fill.</li> </p>

                 <P>  <li>Next: the fold and the wrap. Pretend you are facing north. 
                    Fold over the east and west sides to cover the ingredients by about a 
                    third of the way from each end.</li> </P>

                  <P> <li>Now pull the south side (closest to you) over the ingredients, 
                        allowing a margin at the far end. Pull toward you as you roll northward. 
                        Seal by pushing everything on top of that last bare margin of tortilla. 
                        Sometimes it helps to dip a finger in water and run it along the margin first. 
                        You might need to poke the ends in a bit to keep tucked</li> </P>

                      <p>  <li> To finish, wrap the burrito in the foil in exactly the same way you
                         folded the tortilla. Bake this in the oven for 8 minutes. Lunch is ready.</li> </p>
        </ol>
